│ │  To get started, make sure you have the following requirements satisfied on your machine:
│ │  
│ │  - `pip v22.2.2`
│ │ -- `pipenv v2022.10.12`
│ │ -- Any `python3` version, but 3.8 is recommended
│ │ +- `poetry v.1.4.1`
│ │ +- Any `python3` version, but at least 3.8 is recommended
│ │  
│ │ -Set up a local virtual environment by running `pipenv install --dev` in the project root directory (where the Pipfile is). You can then activate this environment by running `pipenv shell` in the same directory. To check if this step worked, try running `which python` and verify that you get a path to some sort of "virtualenv" as output.
│ │ +Set up a local virtual environment by running `poetry shell` then `poetry install` in the project root directory (where the pyproject.toml is). This should end up putting you in a brand new virtual environment associated with the project, and install all of its dependencies. To check if this step worked, try running `which python` and verify that you get a path to some sort of "virtualenv" as output.
│ │  
│ │  Optionally, but highly recommended to avoid headaches when submitting PRs, is to set up pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install` in the project root (where the .pre-commit-config.yaml file is). This should ensure that your PR at least has style compliant code ✨. If you'd like to be told your code is bad before commiting, feel free to set up linting in your editor of choice. We use `flake8` with a bunch of plugins (including `mypy` and `isort`) to run the style checks, so ideally you'd want to use `flake8` locally for linting as well. In Visual Studio Code, adding the following to your settings file should suffice:
